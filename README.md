# **Sonfive's Pokermon+**
This is an add-on mod for Pokermon - an add-on mod for Balatro. 
The priority for this mod is to add more Decks to the Pokermon mod, allowing you to experience existing content in new ways. This mod does add a few extra consumbles/Jokers, but it is unlikely I add any more in the future
